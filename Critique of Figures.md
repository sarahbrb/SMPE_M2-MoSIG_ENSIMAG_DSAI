### *Criticizing some figures from Jean-Marc's slides [1](https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE/blob/master/sessions/2022_10_Grenoble/02_Intro-Visu.pdf), [2](https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE/blob/master/sessions/2022_10_Grenoble/02_Intro-Visu.pdf)*

#### *1. "Une brève histoire de l'informatique" Figure:*
| Critics            | Proposed Improvements           |
| -------------      | --------------                  |
| The text is somewhat small and cramped, making it hard to read, especially for smaller elements like technical names.       | Create a clearer, multi-tier timeline separating science, technology, and social impacts.                              |
| The use of different colored areas is useful to show societal impact and technological advances, but the yellow area could be more distinct from other parts.                | Increase the font size for important events, and reduce the density of less critical information.                             |
| The overlapping of the colored regions makes it hard to interpret which elements belong to which category. For example, the boundaries between the "Applications" and "Impact sociétal" categories are not clear.            | Use cleaner color blocks with better contrast to differentiate different aspects (e.g., science, technology) without overlapping, and add legends for clarity.                |
| There is a lot of data crammed into the image, making it overwhelming and less accessible. The differentiation between historical periods is hard to grasp quickly. | Use symbols or icons for key innovations, such as the invention of the Internet or the appearance of PCs, to make it easier to quickly understand. |
|The title and major events (e.g., the appearance of FORTRAN, Internet, etc.) are not emphasized enough compared to less significant events.| |

#### *2. "Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos and Claude Bernard" Figures:*
| Critics            | Proposed Improvements           |
| -------------      | -------------                  |
|The text (names and dates) is clear, but the font size for the titles under the images could be increased for better readability.|Create a layout with larger photos and cleaner fonts.|
|The figures effectively show the philosophers and their famous works. However, the Wikipedia and electronic version links could be more useful if they were organized in a more consistent and visually appealing way (e.g., icons instead of plain text).|Use icons for "Wikipedia" and "Electronic version" instead of plain text to create a more intuitive and polished appearance.|
|The structure is somewhat unbalanced. The philosopher's name is central, but the left and right content could be better aligned.|Align the photos and the text more evenly, and maintain consistent padding between elements.|
|The layout of the philosopher’s photo next to the book image is consistent across the slides, which is good. However, the style could be refined to look cleaner (e.g., equal-sized photos).|

#### *3. "Classification of Sciences by Auguste Comte" Figure:*
| Critics            | Proposed Improvements           |
| -------------      | -------------                  |
|  The pyramid structure attempts to represent hierarchical relationships, which is appropriate. | Use a flowchart or layered approach to better indicate the relationships between sciences. |
|The text is readable, but the inverted pyramids can be confusing without clear explanations. The choice of font could be improved for clarity. | Each layer should be labeled with a clear explanation about complexity vs. instrument generality. The inverted pyramids make the relationship ambiguous. Color-coding could be used to distinguish categories or fields. |
| It uses monochrome elements, which avoid excessive similarity in color but could benefit from differentiation. ||
| The figures are labeled, but the relationship between the two inverted pyramids could be more explicit. ||
| The title "Classification of Sciences" is present but lacks detail about what the pyramids represent. ||
| It lacks references in the text or additional clarification on the complexity and generality of sciences. ||

#### *4. "Export of Bananas" Figure:*
| Critics            | Proposed Improvements           |
| -------------      | -------------                  |
| 3D bar charts are generally harder to interpret because the depth perspective can distort the visual accuracy of the bars. This 3D effect makes it difficult to compare values accurately. | Use a 2D bar chart to avoid depth distortion and make the values easier to read. |
| The banana image in the background is distracting and reduces the clarity of the data. It adds no informational value and makes the chart busier than necessary. | Simplify the background by removing the image, leaving a plain, non-distracting background. |
| The years and country names along the axes are hard to read due to the 3D perspective, and the tilted axis labels make it worse. | Use vertical or horizontal bars with a clear, large font for the axis labels and consider spacing the years for better readability. |
| While the color key on the side is helpful, it still leads to a visually overwhelming graph. Too many colors and bars clutter the presentation. | Limit the number of countries displayed at once to reduce clutter, or break the data into multiple charts (e.g., showing top 5 countries per year). |

#### *5. "Monthly Global Mean Temperature" Figure:*
| Critics            | Proposed Improvements           |
| -------------      | -------------                  |
| This chart uses a heat map approach that effectively shows temperature changes over time. It is visually appealing and provides a clear picture of trends. | Consider larger fonts for the years and months to improve readability. |
| The use of red and blue gradients is effective in showing changes, but there are too many shades, which might overwhelm viewers when looking for specific values. | Provide a brief explanation or key takeaways in the image to help viewers understand the data better. |
| The years and temperatures on each individual pie chart are hard to read because they are small. This limits the accessibility of the graphic to those with impaired vision. | Perhaps simplifying the number of color gradations could help make the trend more clear without overwhelming the viewer. |
|  There’s no context or explanation of what is happening with the temperature changes. While the visualization is effective at showing the data, it doesn’t explain what factors contributed to the observed temperature trends. | Adding labels for notable events (e.g., major volcanic eruptions or industrial changes) could provide context to the temperature changes. |

#### *6. "XRP/EUR, 15, BitStamp" Figure :*
| Critics            | Proposed Improvements           |
| -------------      | -------------                  |
| The chart lacks clear annotations or insights about the context of price changes. For a financial audience, it's helpful to indicate important market events or time points (e.g., news releases, regulations) that might have caused price drops or spikes. | Mark key price levels, trendlines, and any significant events (e.g., news, regulation, or market sentiment) that correspond to the rapid price movement seen. |
| The price changes are well represented by the line, and the candlesticks show the highs and lows, which are clear and standard in financial charts. |  Clearly label the axes and include more detailed information on time intervals. Adding a title or description for beginners who are unfamiliar with the time frame (15-minute) would also improve accessibility. |
| The colors used for the candlesticks are not overly distracting, which is good, but they lack clear contrast. A clearer distinction between upward and downward movement (e.g., a stronger green/red difference) could make the chart easier to interpret at a glance. | Use stronger colors for upward vs downward movements (e.g., green for bullish candlesticks, red for bearish) to make the chart easier to interpret at a glance. |
| While the 15-minute intervals are common for short-term trading analysis, there’s no clear label explaining that the X-axis shows time. A beginner looking at this might not realize the time intervals represent 15 minutes, as it’s not labeled directly. | Add volume bars, moving averages, or other key trading indicators to provide more in-depth analysis for traders. |
| The price scale seems appropriate, but there is no clarity on what might have led to the sharp drop seen in the middle of the chart. Adding trend lines, support and resistance levels, or annotations explaining major movements could make the graph more informative.| Including indicators or lines that highlight trading strategies (e.g., Fibonacci retracements, Bollinger Bands) would give traders a clearer picture of when to enter or exit trades. |
| This chart would benefit from additional indicators or overlays like moving averages, volume indicators, or RSI (relative strength index) to give more actionable information. Without them, it’s harder to make conclusions about whether the price is likely to go up or down based on technical analysis. ||
| The numbers on the Y-axis (price) are clear and easy to read, but the chart could use more detailed labeling (e.g., highlighting significant price levels such as resistance or support levels). ||
| While the chart provides basic information like the trading pair and exchange, it lacks more advanced charting tools or a brief commentary, which would be helpful for interpreting the movements. ||

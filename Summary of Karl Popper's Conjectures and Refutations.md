*Summary of [Karl Popper's Conjectures and Refutations](https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE/blob/master/sessions/2024_10_Grenoble/02_reading_Popper_Conjectures-and-refutation.pdf)*

In Conjectures and Refutations, Karl Popper explores the difference between science and pseudo-science. He argues that the key feature of a scientific theory is its falsifiability, the ability to be tested and potentially proven wrong by evidence. While pseudo-scientific theories (like astrology, Freudian psychology, or Marxism) explain everything and cannot be refuted, true scientific theories make bold predictions that can be tested and, if found false, rejected. Popper emphasizes that genuine scientific progress is made by proposing theories that risk refutation and undergoing rigorous testing. He concludes that falsifiability is the criterion that separates scientific knowledge from non-scientific beliefs.
